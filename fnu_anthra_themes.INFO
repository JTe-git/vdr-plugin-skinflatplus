These are flat anthra style themes following good old anthra packages from Tomas Saxer
for vdr-plugin-text2skin. As with the originals base theme is red highlighted, authors
favorit is amber highlighted, one for yaVDR family is yablue highlighted and a green one.

Themes are black, anthrazit, grey style with some accents in given colors and like the
original themes with a white logo base. All kept flat to fit into strenght of skinflatplus.

Author does recommend to use "round big" decor and nopacity-default logos from Copperhead,
because of the white logo base:
